    <h1>Love at first bite</h1>
    <h2>The story of delicious nachos</h2>
    <p>On July 7, 2010, at a cocktail party hosted by their mutual boss from the Museum of Anthropology, Nicholas Jakobsen put a tray of the strangest nachos Brianne Phaff had ever seen down in front of her. That tray sparked a conversation, and by the end of the night, Nick had fooled Bre into giving him her number. Nearly five years later, on December 25, 2014, in matching Christmas sweaters, Nick asked Bre to marry him.</p>
